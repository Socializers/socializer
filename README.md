## Web Application

The CRUD web application consists of a Backend at this stage. The backend was written in Javascript using node.js.

Our application is provided to help people in our local communites to invest their time on either learning new stuff related to what they struggle in their life or to entertain themselves.

The user will be able to observe and learn a set of new skills in the education part in our web app, in addition to that,the user will have the ability to entertain him/her self in a various way that are included in the entertainment section in our app.

Our web app will have only a backend at this moment and we will add the frontend once we reach the second part of our course.
